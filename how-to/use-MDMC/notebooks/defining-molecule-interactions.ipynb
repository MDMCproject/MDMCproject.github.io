Calculating this contribution can be very slow - the time taken to do so *quadruples* when the number of atoms in the system doubles. To do this more efficiently, MD engines use algorithms known as *K-space solvers*.\n",

If you would like to calculate the long range contribution to the non-bonded energy during a simulation, a KSpace solver has to be added to the universe. A solver can be specified for either electrostatic or dispersive interactions, or both. This can either be during universe initialisation or afterwards:"
