    "# Creating an Observable from a Simulation \n",
    "When running a refinement, MDMC makes quantitative comparisons between properties measured experimentally and calculated from MD simulations: within MDMC each of these properties is an `Observable`. Examples of these observables are the dynamic structure factor, $S(Q,\\omega)$, and the pair distribution function, $G(r)$.\n",
