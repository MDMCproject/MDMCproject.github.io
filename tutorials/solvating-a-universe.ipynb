    "Explanations of each parameter passed to ``solvate`` can be found below.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. ``density``\n",
    "The desired density of the bulk solvent in your universe, in MDMC units of **amu / Ang ^ 3**. See [Units in MDMC](units.ipynb) for instructions on how to convert your density into MDMC units.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: with this parameter you are specifying the **bulk density of the solvent**. If you have any solute molecules already present in your universe, the total density of your universe after solvation will be higher than the desired density you pass to ``solvate`` (plus or minus the tolerance you pass, see below).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above example, passing the density as ``0.6`` means that the universe will be solvated with SPCE water with a bulk density of 0.6 amu / Ang ^ 3 (+/- the tolerance). The density of the universe **in total will be greater** than 0.6 amu / Ang ^ 3, because of the 4 Hydrogen molecules.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. ``tolerance``\n",
    "With this parameter you can specify the percentage tolerance of the ``density`` that you would like to be achieved for the bulk density of the solvent. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the above example, passing a density of ``0.6`` and setting ``tolerance=1`` will achieve a bulk solvent density of:\n",
    "\n",
    "* (0.6 amu / Ang ^ 3)  +/-  1 %\n",
    "* equivalent to (0.6  +/-  0.006) amu / Ang ^ 3\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: the tolerance has a default value of 1 %. Setting the tolerance to anything lower than increases the risk of ``solvate`` not converging to within the specified tolerance.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. ``solvent``\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Using a solvent with pre-defined coordinates.\n",
    "\n",
    "MDMC has a few in-built solvents that can be used to solvate your Universe. These have pre-defined atomic coordinates and interactions. \n",
