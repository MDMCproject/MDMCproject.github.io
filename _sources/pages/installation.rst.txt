Installation
============

You can install MDMC in broadly two ways.  For non-expert users, it is strongly
recommended that you use containers to run MDMC (option 1), as you will not have
to separately install a supported molecular dynamics package (e.g. LAMMPS).

1. Container option: run MDMC in a container that already has all relevant
   external dependencies pre-installed, including molecular dynamics engines.

 * Two container technologies are supported: Docker and Singularity. Docker has
   more widespread usage, but Singularity is targeted for HPC hardware. These
   two container technologies are similar to operate, and once you are familiar
   with one, switching to the other should be relatively straightforward.

2. Non-container option: directly onto your favourite hardware and OS, e.g. Mac
  or Linux laptop or HPC hardware.

* **However** this requires that one or more molecular dynamics engines
  (e.g. `LAMMPS <https://lammps.sandia.gov>`_) are already installed.





Singularity
-----------
Singularity is an alternative to Docker which has been designed specifically for
high performance computing (HPC), with the majority of HPC centres providing
support for Singularity. If Singularity is installed, run MDMC in parallel
using:

.. code-block:: bash

  mpirun -np 12 singularity exec mdmc.sif python3 script.py

where "script.py" is the name of the script which will run MDMC.  In this
example MDMC will be split over 12 processes.


Source Code
-----------
Source code is available from https://github.com/MDMCproject/MDMCv0.2_pilot and
can be obtained using git with:

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/MDMCproject/MDMCv0.2_pilot.git
